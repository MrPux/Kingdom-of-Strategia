Explanation of the steps taken to display the generated map with villages:

1.  The initial goal was to display a generated map with villages on the frontend, using the `village.png` asset.

2.  The first attempt resulted in a Whitelabel Error Page with a `NullPointerException` in the `LinkedList.add` method. This was due to an error in the `LinkedList` implementation. The `add` method was trying to set the next node of a null head. I corrected the `LinkedList.java` file to properly handle the case where the head is null.

3.  After fixing the `LinkedList` implementation, the application still resulted in a Whitelabel Error Page, but this time with a `TemplateInputException` and a `SpelEvaluationException`. This was because the Thymeleaf template was trying to access the `x` and `y` properties of the `LinkedList` object, not the `Village` object within the list. I modified the `GameMap` class to use an `ArrayList` instead of a `LinkedList` and to return a list of `Village` objects.

4.  After modifying the `GameMap` class, the application still resulted in a `TemplateInputException` and a `SpelEvaluationException`. This was because the `Village` class did not have public fields or getter methods for the `x` and `y` coordinates. The `Village` class had getter methods, but they were named `getXCordinate` and `getYCordinate`. I updated the `index.html` file to use these getter methods instead of trying to access the `x` and `y` fields directly.

5.  After updating the `index.html` file, the application was running without errors, but the image was not being displayed. This was because the static resources were not being served correctly. By default, Spring Boot serves static resources from the `src/main/resources/static` directory. However, the `village.png` file was located in the `src/main/resources/assets` directory. I moved the `village.png` file to the `src/main/resources/static/assets` directory using the `execute_command` tool.

What the user was doing wrong:

*   The user was not providing a correct `LinkedList` implementation.
*   The user was not correctly accessing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the `Village` object in the Thymeleaf template.
*   The user was not serving the static resources correctly.

How I accomplished it:

*   I corrected the `LinkedList` implementation.
*   I modified the `GameMap` class to use an `ArrayList` instead of a `LinkedList`.
*   I updated the `index.html` file to use the correct getter methods for the `x` and `y` coordinates of the villages.
*   I moved the `village.png` file to the `src/main/resources/static/assets` directory using the `execute_command` tool.
